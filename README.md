# Music-Generation-using-Neural-Network
This project explores music generation using neural networks to create unique compositions. 
By training models like LSTM or Transformers on musical data, the system learns patterns and 
structures to generate melodies. The approach enables AI-assisted music composition, with 
applications in automated songwriting, background music, and personalized soundtracks. This 
study highlights the potential of deep learning in enhancing creativity and innovation in music 
production. Music generation using neural networks is a rapidly evolving field that leverages 
deep learning techniques to create unique and melodious compositions. This project explores 
the use of artificial intelligence to generate music by training a neural network on a dataset of 
musical sequences. The model learns patterns, harmonies, and structures, enabling it to produce 
coherent and aesthetically pleasing compositions. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long 
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, or Transformer-based models are utilized to enhance 
the quality and creativity of generated music. The system takes input in the form of musical 
notes, MIDI files, or other structured representations and generates new compositions based on 
learned patterns. This research aims to demonstrate how AI can assist musicians, composers, 
and music enthusiasts in the creative process.
